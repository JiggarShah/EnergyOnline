	\subsection{Challenge 3: Virtual Energy Storage}
	
	How might the blockchain technology help to develop a reliable and highly efficient virtual energy solution that gives anyone the possibility to produce, store and use his/her own energy anywhere and anytime?
	
	\subsection{Problem}
	40\% of the electricity in Switzerland is provided by nuclear power plants, witch will stop producing energy in 2034. To cover demands, a lot more renewable energy must be produced. 
	Currently, energy surplus from private power plants (mainly PV) can only be sold to local energy provider for a fixed price. Combined with high entry barriers PV's are very unprofitable. 
	
	Our solution is to incentive more private power plants by making them more profitable and flexible.
	
	\section{Overview}
	
	\paragraph{}
	In the first phase Owners of private power plants are given an account witch traces the amount of energy fed into the network. The same amount of energy can be used later, when needed. Data is stored centralized by ewz.  This solution can be implemented by ewz alone. A blockchain is not needed for this phase. 
	
	"Smart Meters" could improve the process of checking power production and consumption, by directly transmitting the data.
	
	\paragraph{}
	In a second phase the "cloud storage" is replaced by a blockchain based "energy token". This system can be scaled to the whole of Switzerland. These tokens can be traded freely, allowing the producers to get a higher price, than the fixed price received, when selling power to the grid provider. Tokens could also be used to pay for different services, for example charging an electric car, provided by other parties. 
	
	\paragraph{}
	In the third phase we introduce a "Decentralized Automated Organisation" (DAO) witch trades energy tokens and subsidises new renewable power plants.
