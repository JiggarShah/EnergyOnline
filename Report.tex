	\section{The Problem}
	
	40\% of the electricity in Switzerland is provided by nuclear power plants, witch have to stop producing energy in 2034. To cover demands, a lot more renewable energy must be produced. 
	Currently, energy surplus from private power plants (mainly PV) can only be sold to local energy provider for a fixed price. Combined with high entry barriers PV's are very unprofitable.
	Our solution is to incentive more private power plants by making them more profitable and flexible.
	
	\section{The Vision}
	Our goal is to create a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). The DAO issues energy tokens for energy produced, witch can be traded freely through the blockchain network. The tokens can then be used to receive electricity again. The DAO uses the surplus energy in the network to trade on the energy stock market. With the profit from trading, new renewable power plants are subsidized. 
	
	\section{The way there}
	
	\subsection{Decentralised Autonomous Organisation DAO}
	The DAO is a blockchain based network. To become a member you have to feed renewable energy into the network. As a member you have the right
